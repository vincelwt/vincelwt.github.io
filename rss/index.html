Every once in while, I sit and think about useful things I can share and note them on Buffer.</p><p>I love Buffer, the product and their company are pretty cool. But they're a bit pricey for those like me. The free plan is limited to 10 items in the queue.</p><p>So I set out to create a home-cooked alternative to be able to schedule as many tweets as I like. </p><p>For the 'database', storage of the tweets, <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a> ended up being the best choice. <br>Cloud based, easy API, multiple views: perfect use-case. </p><p>For the actual <em>tweeting</em> code, it would've been a bit tedious to roll a dedicated web server so it's hosted on a free <a href="https://webtask.io">Webtask</a> function. They allow to set a cron job to schedule functions to run every x minutes.</p><h2 id="create-airtable-workplace">Create Airtable workplace<br></h2><p>If you haven't already, sign up on Airtable and create a new workplace. Call it as you want. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="DIY tweet scheduling (Buffer) with Airtable"><figcaption>My jolie Airtable tweets queue</figcaption></figure><p>The "Schedule" checkbox is for quickly disabling scheduling on a tweet.<br>The "Tweeted" property is a way for the script to know if a tweet as already been treated and not send it twice.</p><p>The table structure (column names) doesn't <em>need to </em>be the same, but you would have to update the code below with the names you've used. Same for the name of the table.</p><p>Next, head to their<a href="https://airtable.com/api"> API section </a>and click on your workplace. There, in the code examples you'll find your API key and your Base ID, which is all you'll need on this side.</p><h2 id="register-as-a-developer-on-twitter">Register as a developer on Twitter<br></h2><p>If you're not already, apply as a developer on Twitter.<br><br>Then, <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps">create a new app</a>. <br><br>Give them all the infos they need (I know, bit of a pain in the ass). <br>Once you're done, head to the "Keys and tokens<strong>" </strong>section and get your Consumer API keys. <br>You will also need an access token &amp; the secret because we don't want to bother with OAuth for this one.</p><h2 id="create-the-webtask-function">Create the Webtask function<br></h2><p>Then, we need to make sure the function will run at interval. I set an interval of 30 min but you can set less if you need too. </p><p>In any case, the script will tweet any Tweet that should be tweeted (that's a lot of tweet) within an interval of 1 hour.</p><div>

It's a balance.</p><p>Nothing replaces memories. It what makes us feel great, or bad, looking at certains events from the past. I agree 100% with spending money to create memories. </p><p>But you shouldn't live everything just thinking about how others and you in the future will perceive it. <br>Be in <a href="https://getharmony.xyz">harmony</a> with your actions and remember to live the moment to the best that you can üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br><br>It's quite hard, to just pause and appreciate moments.

Once you're ready, go! </p><h2 id="knowing-your-tools">Knowing your tools<br></h2><p>Much underlooked: knowing what tech to use. <br>What you master. Not jumping in there with the latest new stuff you saw trending on HN / Twitter. </p><p>Learnt this the hard way with the <a href="https://serverless.com">serverless</a> module, back when it was the new thing to try. It was still very early but I didn't care. <br>I'd host it on AWS so it's cheap and use some DB that <em>looks</em> like Mongo, Dynamo. </p><p>The amount of time I lost figuring out ways around contraints imposed by <em>serverless</em>, and the amount of time it took me to figure out how to use well DynamoDB was just not worth it,<em> in what I was trying to achieve</em> which wasn't a the time learning a new tech.<br>I spent time debugging like hell, but as it was still relatively a new tech, the internet wasn't full of explanations and blog posts on the issues I encountered.<br>Go for more mature tech.</p><p>For me, after a bunch of experimention, I now generally use:</p><ul><li>Express, ejs, mongoose, passport (for users), </li><li>Stripe for payments</li><li>Hand made CSS (with a lot shared between pages) for landing page</li><li>Bootstrap 4 + jQuery for dashboards</li></ul><p>It might not be the best for 2019 but at least it's reliable.<br>Maybe I'd be better off with React, a serverless architecture, using GraphQL. <br>It doesn't matter to me.</p><p>It doesn't mean you shouldn't try new stuff! it's fun to experiment.<br>Depends on what you want, is it learning this new thing, or building fast? Just be careful about not going too spread. <br>It took a time to decide myself on my current stack after lot of experimentation including Rails, PHP and Django on some projects.</p><h3 id="components">Components</h3><p>You should re-use at the maximum your code between projects.</p><p>Recently I started splitting recurring parts of my projects into components, Node modules:<br>- I have <a href="https://github.com/lyserio/express-account-pages">a module</a> that handles authentification and account management through passport. ¬†<br>- <a href="https://github.com/lyserio/express-billing-page">One</a> that handles billing with Stripe, managing user subscriptions, adding removing cards, ¬†upgrading your account, etc... <br>- O<a href="https://github.com/lyserio/express-admin-page">ne</a> that gives an overview on my users and how they're using the app.<br>- And <a href="https://github.com/lyserio/express-error-page">one</a> that generate nice error pages.</p><p>As of right now I use them in ~5 different projects. <br>For now they're pretty basic feature-wise but as I'll go and add more, they'll be available on all the products as simply as by updating the dependencies.</p><p>These modules make sense only because I know I'll use the same technology (Express, mongo) in later projects. </p><h2 id="focus-on-the-important-and-shortcuts">Focus on the important and shortcuts<br></h2><p>It's important to be good at prioritizing things. Not losing focus to useless/notthatuseful things. <br>Legal notices and privacy policy don't matter at the beginning. <br>You'll add them later when you have some time for that. Then re-use them as much as possible.</p><p><br>Focus on tasks that advance you the most toward your target and go pieces by pieces on it. <br>Be careful not to be too drawn toward the big picture because you'll get discouraged. Map limits for your MVP and try sticking close to them. <br>That doesn't mean you shouldn't adapt to what you learn on the way of course.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The magic of social proof]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>According to wikipedia, the social proof phenomenon<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect"> </a>can be described as "<em>a psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behavior in a given situation</em>".</p><p>Basically, we as humans, are trained to take shortcuts in the decision-making process.</p><p>Instead of wasting hours</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/social-proof/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c38e92e67cf9a61d7da0924</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vince]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 19:26:41 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to wikipedia, the social proof phenomenon<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect"> </a>can be described as "<em>a psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behavior in a given situation</em>".</p><p>Basically, we as humans, are trained to take shortcuts in the decision-making process.</p><p>Instead of wasting hours researching each and every decision, we trust a lot the decisions of our peers.</p><p>It's a lot similar to the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect">Bandwagon Effect</a>", a well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive bias</a>.

</div><p>Who knows if humans were ever supposed to do this?</p><p>Although there is arguably some magic to their usages, it's a mistake thinking they'd solve all our problems magically. Even worse is that contraction between knowing it's probably all in your head but still like feeling like its very very real. Was it all chemicals in my brain? <br>Really you can think about however you want, you will never know and it doesn't matter. It's about the experience.</p><p>We need to be careful with these explorations.<br>Emphasising education not only on the consumption but everything that comes before and after. People should be prepared, Set &amp; Setting is important. </p><p>Having practised meditation will be hugely beneficial during an experience. Having some clue as to<em> </em>how you think. Having already tried mind-altering substances will de-stigmatise what's happening.</p><p>Curiosity, although a very valid reason in my opinion, shouldn't be the only drive to trying psychedelics.</p><p>Bad trips can make people find themselves lost, broken or unable to make sense of what's happening. It's important not to feel alone.<br>Brain material, talks, literature, thoughts processes and tales of fellow "travelers" are helpful during an experience and the "recovery" period.<br>They key is remembering <strong>it will pass</strong>. Like everything in life. </p><p>Think of your brain as a snow globe. After an experience, it can be quite shaken up and uncomfortable. Just thinking can make you tired.

</div><p>Don't try to put everything behind, the mind doesn't work that way. <br>If you choose to not deal with an issue, then you give up your right of control over the issue.</p><p>Then is the feeling of not knowing what was real and what was not. </p><p>Community is awesome. <br>Reddit and forums have great people and posts. <br>Even best, having people to talk with while tripping is an experience all by its self. Nothing replace real-life interactions. It can get crazy! </p><p>Myself I found my first real experience to be like a seed. No 'enlightenment' or answer or whatever you can except to receive. <br>It's more being confronted to your own self, for what it is. </p><p>That seed still has his ramifications over my life and decisions. <br>I have some reflections and thoughts that I didn't know I could have before. <br>That made me more open to new things, like a new perspective.

If in the future you modify the HTML, your users will use the updated version instead of an old cached one.</p><pre><code>const saveState = () =&gt; {
	console.log('Saving window for faster startup...')

	// regex .replace is for escaping mfucking windows paths
	let writePath = path.join(app.getPath('userData'), 'harmony'+app.getVersion()+'_index.html').replace(/\\/g, "\\\\") 

	// Cache rendered html for faster startup üöÄ
	
	window.webContents.executeJavaScript(`
		
		// This part depends on your app
		// In my case, I reset some elements to their original page before saving the page

		// Reset ui elements

		getById('playerBufferBar').style.transform = getById('playerProgressBar').style.transform = 'translateX(0%)'
		
		addClass('playpauseIcon', 'icon-play')
		removeClass('playpauseIcon', 'icon-pause')
		removeClass(".playingIcon", "blink")
		addClass('refreshStatus', 'hide')

		// Here we write the DOM to the 'userData' folder
		// so we can use this for the next startup

		fs.writeFileSync("${writePath}",  '&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;'+document.documentElement.outerHTML)

		// Save settings
		store.set('settings', settings)
	
	`)
}
</code></pre><p>Reset/remove the elements of the UI you want in place and save the HTML to a new file in the <code>userData</code> directory.</p><blockquote>Make sure your saved HTML begins with <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> ¬†or it won't work when we loading from the Data URL. Spent a while on that one :P</blockquote><p>Now we invoke the function on <code>before-quit</code>, every time we close the app.</p><pre><code>app.on('before-quit', () =&gt;  {
	willQuitApp = true
	
	saveState()
})

</code></pre><p>Also call it from your app window's <code>close</code> event:</p><pre><code>window.on('close', (e) =&gt; {
	saveState()

	if (willQuitApp || process.platform !== 'darwin') {
		/* the user tried to quit the app */
		window = null
	} else {
		/* the user only tried to close the window */
		e.preventDefault()
		window.hide()
	}
})

</code></pre><p>Now, if the user has the cached <code>index.html</code> in his cache load it will use it instead of the default <code>index.html</code>.</p><pre><code>let cachedIndex = path.join(app.getPath('userData'), `/your_app${app.getVersion()}_index.html`) // Used for faster startup

let indexToPull = fs.existsSync(cachedIndex) ? cachedIndex : path.join(__dirname, '/app/index.html')

// We read the file content 
// so the Node context isn't in the userData folder
const pageContent = fs.readFileSync(indexToPull,'utf8')

window.loadURL('data:text/html;charset=UTF-8,' + encodeURIComponent(pageContent), {
	baseURLForDataURL: `file://${__dirname}/app/`
})
</code></pre><p>Depending on if a cached HTML exists, we load the corresponding file.</p><p>We can't load the cached file from its path as we'll be placed in the <code>userData</code> directory and won't be able to access any static files (CSS, JS, images).</p><p>So we have to read it and then send it as a Data URL to be rendered.</p><p>Now however, your JS context will be 'placed' in the same directory as your main process file. </p><p>Say you have in <code>app.js</code> some local dependencies like <code>require('./utils/db')</code> - well it won't work. You're relative to your main folder.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">require('./app/js/utils/db')
</code></pre>
<h2 id="end-words">End words<br></h2><p>The caveat to this technique is even if the UI appears loaded, you can't interact with the app until the proper JS is fully loaded.</p><p>This can be further optimized by loading first only the UI interaction code then the rest. For most users its not noticeable tho.</p><p>I'll maybe try to build a module if that can be useful to other apps.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Manifesto]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stay hungry, stay foolish.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/manifesto/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c1cebd5e86efb7d1ffac8d7</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vince]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 13:34:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="stay-hungry-stay-foolish">Stay hungry, stay foolish</h2><ul><li>Be curious about everything, experiment with a maximum of things.</li><li>Learn the subjects that interest you.</li><li>Don't be afraid of something because you don't understand it.

Their implementations already being legally blurry, I didn't want to take the risk to expose myself to legal issues.</p><p>So to make it easier for people to develop their own plugins &amp; themes and to protect them from being forever removed by the big companies (Spotify, Google &amp; co) I chose to open-source on GitHub.</p><p>It is possible than in the future buying a license unlocks features in Harmony, I just haven't found what features deserve to be premium.</p><h3 id="the-pricing">The pricing</h3><p>At first, I wanted to maximize revenue recurrence.</p><p>So, inspired by <a href="https://fman.io">fman</a>'s model, went with the following model:</p><ul><li><strong>$15/year</strong>: a lifetime license</li><li><strong>$15</strong>: a license for the current <strong>major</strong> version ¬†(meaning that if you bought a license when 0.5 was out, it worked with 0.5.1, 0.5.2, etc..) </li></ul><p>The issue is that Harmony is adressed to a different public than fman's.</p><p>Few persons would actually pay anually for a music player. And you can't have it paid by your company as an expense.</p><p>Approximately 50% of the licenses sold were subscriptions.</p><p>Another issue is I wasn't sure I'd still want to carry out with Harmony's development in <em>x</em> years.</p><p>So I switched to a simpler model:</p><ul><li><strong>$40</strong>: a lifetime license</li><li><strong>$15</strong>: a license for the current version only </li></ul><p>On top of that, users buying a lifetime license get access to a features-request page (on Trello).</p><h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3><p>Switching to a commercial model was the right move for Harmony.</p><p>Time is saved (maintaining an open-source project <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer">takes time</a>) and I get paid for my work.</p><p>Also, I can now report that almost all licenses sold are lifetime licenses, resulting in higher revenues.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/money.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Kidding, I still haven't paid in full my MacBook.</figcaption></figure><p>On a sidenote, I remarked that even tho you don't actually<em> have to</em> buy a license to use Harmony and all its features, a lot of people are buying the app before even trying it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weekend project: Build an automated YouTube Channel]]></title><description><![CDATA[Nice background]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/build-automated-youtube-channel/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c1cf1f9e86efb7d1ffac911</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vince]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2017 17:05:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/youtubetrend-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/youtubetrend-1.jpg" alt="Weekend project: Build an automated YouTube Channel"><p>You can't miss it.
