	console.log('Saving window for faster startup...')

	let writePath = path.join(app.getPath('userData'), 'harmony'+app.getVersion()+'_index.html').replace(/\\/g, "\\\\") 

	// Cache rendered html for faster startup ð
	// regex .replace is for escaping mfucking windows paths
	window.webContents.executeJavaScript(`
		// Reset ui elements
		
		getById('playerBufferBar').style.transform = getById('playerProgressBar').style.transform = 'translateX(0%)'
		
		addClass('playpauseIcon', 'icon-play')
		removeClass('playpauseIcon', 'icon-pause')

		fs.writeFileSync("${writePath}",  '&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;'+document.documentElement.outerHTML)

		// Save settings
		store.set('settings', settings)
	
	`)
}
</code></pre><p>Reset/remove the elements of the UI you want in place and save the HTML to a new file in the <code>userData</code> directory.</p><p>Make sure to start by <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> in your file or it won't work when we load it from the Data URL. I spent a while figuring this out.</p><p>Now invoke the function from your app's <code>before-quit</code> event:</p><pre><code>app.on('before-quit', () =&gt;  {
	willQuitApp = true
	
	saveState()
})

</code></pre><p>Also call it from your app's window's <code>close</code> event:</p><pre><code>window.on('close', (e) =&gt; {
	saveState()

	if (willQuitApp || process.platform !== 'darwin') {
		/* the user tried to quit the app */
		window = null
	} else {
		/* the user only tried to close the window */
		e.preventDefault()
		window.hide()
	}
})

</code></pre><p>Now, if the user has the cached <code>index.html</code> in his cache load it instead of the default <code>index.html</code>:</p><pre><code>let cachedIndex = path.join(app.getPath('userData'), `/your_app${app.getVersion()}_index.html`) // Used for faster startup
let indexToPull = fs.existsSync(cachedIndex) ? cachedIndex : path.join(__dirname, '/app/index.html')
	
const pageContent = fs.readFileSync(indexToPull,'utf8')

window.loadURL('data:text/html;charset=UTF-8,' + encodeURIComponent(pageContent), {
	baseURLForDataURL: `file://${__dirname}/app/`
})
</code></pre><p>Depending on if a cached HTML exists, we load the corresponding file.</p><p>We can't load the cached file from it's path as we'll be placed in the <code>userData</code> directory and you won't be able to access any static files (CSS, JS, images).</p><p>So we have to read it and then send it as a Data URL to be rendered.</p><p>Now however, your JS will be 'placed' in the same directory as your main process file. Say you have in <code>app.js</code> some local dependencies like <code>require('./utils/db')</code> - well it won't work.</p><p>As a simple workaroung hack, I ended up importing my local dependencies like this:</p><pre><code>if (__dirname.replace(/\//g, '').endsWith("app")) {
	__dirname = path.join(__dirname, '/app')
}

const utils = require(path.join(__dirname, '/js/utils.js'))
</code></pre><p>As <code>app.js</code> will get loaded from the same folder as <code>main.js</code> <strong>or</strong> from <code>app/settings.html</code> we want to make sure <code>__dirname</code> is always the at the root of where I store my <code>.js</code> files - that's why we make sure it's the correct directory and update it if not.</p><h2 id="end-words">End words</h2><p>The caveat to this technique is even if the UI appears loaded, you can't interact with the app until the proper JS is fully loaded.</p><p>This can be further optimized by loading first only the UI interaction code then the rest.</p><p>For most users it won't be noticeable tho.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Manifesto]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stay hungry, stay foolish.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/manifesto/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c1cebd5e86efb7d1ffac8d7</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vincent]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 13:34:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="stay-hungry-stay-foolish">Stay hungry, stay foolish</h2><ul><li>Be curious about everything, experiment with a maximum of things.</li><li>Learn the subjects that interest you.</li><li>Don't be afraid of something because you don't understand it.

Their implementations already being legally blurry, I didn't want to take the risk to expose myself to legal issues.</p><p>So to make it easier for people to develop their own plugins &amp; themes and to protect them from being forever removed by the big companies (Spotify, Google &amp; co) I chose to open-source on GitHub.</p><p>It is possible than in the future buying a license unlocks features in Harmony, I just haven't found what features deserve to be premium.</p><h3 id="the-pricing">The pricing</h3><p>At first, I wanted to maximize revenue recurrence.</p><p>So, inspired by <a href="https://fman.io">fman</a>'s model, went with the following model:</p><ul><li><strong>$15/year</strong>: a lifetime license</li><li><strong>$15</strong>: a license for the current <strong>major</strong> version Â (meaning that if you bought a license when 0.5 was out, it worked with 0.5.1, 0.5.2, etc..) </li></ul><p>The issue is that Harmony is adressed to a different public than fman's.</p><p>Few persons would actually pay anually for a music player. And you can't have it paid by your company as an expense.</p><p>Approximately 50% of the licenses sold were subscriptions.</p><p>Another issue is I wasn't sure I'd still want to carry out with Harmony's development in <em>x</em> years.</p><p>So I switched to a simpler model:</p><ul><li><strong>$40</strong>: a lifetime license</li><li><strong>$15</strong>: a license for the current version only </li></ul><p>On top of that, users buying a lifetime license get access to a features-request page (on Trello).</p><h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3><p>Switching to a commercial model was the right move for Harmony.</p><p>Time is saved (maintaining an open-source project <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer">takes time</a>) and I get paid for my work.</p><p>Also, I can now report that almost all licenses sold are lifetime licenses, resulting in higher revenues.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/money.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Kidding, I still haven't paid in full my MacBook.</figcaption></figure><p>On a sidenote, I remarked that even tho you don't actually<em> have to</em> buy a license to use Harmony and all its features, a lot of people are buying the app before even trying it.</p><p>Wondering what's the best model for your app?

Today, the trend on YouTube is for static music videos with beautiful girls or landscapes. More often that not with the channel logo upfront.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/youtubetrend.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Weekend project: Build an automated YouTube Channel"></figure><p>I wanted to see if it was possible to create this kind of channel, fully automated with just a Python script.</p><p>The first step is to find a music source.</p><p>I wanted to find tracks not yet popular on YouTube but with a clear public interest.</p><p>I settled on the <a href="http://hypem.com/popular">"Popular Now"</a> playlist on Hype Machine. This was perfect as HypeMachine already as an API, so no need to go scrape the website.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/hypem.png" class="kg-image" alt="Weekend project: Build an automated YouTube Channel"></figure><p>Then, I needed elements to create the static image associated with the music.</p><p>For the background image, Unplash was the obvious choice. I created a collection of ~200 images that would fit for the videos. I would then only need to fetch a random one with <code>https://source.unsplash.com/collection/&lt;collectionid&gt;/1920x1080</code>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Weekend project: Build an automated YouTube Channel"></figure><p>I also needed my logo to be put on each video, so I made a quick one.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/titlelayer.png" class="kg-image" alt="Weekend project: Build an automated YouTube Channel"></figure><p>Here is what it would like at the end, after a quick merge:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/final.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Weekend project: Build an automated YouTube Channel"></figure><p>Neat right?</p><p>I then created a folder for every channel I wanted to automate.<br>This allow me to easily add more channels, in less than 5 minutes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/12/directory.png" class="kg-image" alt="Weekend project: Build an automated YouTube Channel"></figure><p><code>creds.json</code> contains the channel's oAuth token needed to upload videos to YouTube.</p><p><code>info.json</code> is a very simple file containing some needed infos for the script:</p><pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Chill Ocean&quot;,&quot;image&quot;: &quot;https://source.unsplash.com/collection//1920x1080&quot;,
